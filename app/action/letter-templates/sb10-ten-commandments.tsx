Subject: Please Oppose SB 10 (89th) — Required Display of the Ten Commandments in Classrooms

SB 10 requires the Ten Commandments to be displayed in every public school classroom.

Dear [Rep./Sen. Last Name],

As your constituent in [Your City/County/District], I'm writing to urge you to oppose SB 10 (89th). I appreciate your service to our district and to Texas. My concern is that this measure could lead to unintended harms for students, educators, and families across our community.

Personal Impact (add 2-4 sentences about how this bill affects you, your school, or your community).

Key Concerns:
• Raises significant constitutional questions about government endorsement of religion; invites costly litigation for districts.
• Texas classrooms serve students of many faiths and none; mandatory display may alienate families and undermine inclusion.
• Does not improve academic outcomes; diverts attention and resources from evidence-based supports (literacy, counseling, safety).

What I'm Asking:
• Repeal or suspend implementation pending judicial review and comprehensive community consultation.
• If not repealed, provide state funding for any legal and implementation costs districts incur.
• Adopt policies that affirm religious neutrality and protect students' freedom of conscience.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss this further with your staff. Please let me know where you currently stand on this bill and how you plan to protect students, educators, and our community.

Respectfully,

[Your Name]
