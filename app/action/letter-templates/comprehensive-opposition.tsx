Subject: Please Oppose Multiple Bills (SB 2, HB 1481, SB 10, HB 4, HB 229) — Comprehensive Opposition to Recently Passed Measures

This letter offers a consolidated message on multiple measures affecting education, civil rights, and representation.

Dear [Rep./Sen. Last Name],

As your constituent in [Your City/County/District], I'm writing to urge you to oppose Multiple Bills (SB 2, HB 1481, SB 10, HB 4, HB 229). I appreciate your service to our district and to Texas. My concern is that this measure could lead to unintended harms for students, educators, and families across our community.

Personal Impact (add 2-4 sentences about how this bill affects you, your school, or your community).

Key Concerns:
• Education funding and equity (SB 2): risk of diverting resources from public schools without equivalent accountability.
• Student learning environment (HB 1481): device rules need flexibility for accessibility, CTE, emergencies, and equity.
• Religious neutrality (SB 10): mandatory displays raise constitutional and inclusion concerns for diverse classrooms.
• Fair representation (HB 4): redistricting should protect communities of interest and minority voting strength.
• Civil documentation (HB 229): definitions and record rules must respect medical realities and individual rights.

What I'm Asking:
• Revisit each measure with stakeholder input; add safeguards, fiscal transparency, and rights protections.
• Publish implementation guidance with funding for compliance rather than imposing unfunded mandates.
• Commit to ongoing public reporting so Texans can evaluate real-world impacts over time.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss this further with your staff. Please let me know where you currently stand on this bill and how you plan to protect students, educators, and our community.

Respectfully,

[Your Name]
