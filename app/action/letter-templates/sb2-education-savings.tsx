Subject: Please Oppose SB 2 (89th) — Education Savings Account Program

SB 2 establishes an ESA program that channels public funds to private educational uses.

Dear [Rep./Sen. Last Name],

As your constituent in [Your City/County/District], I'm writing to urge you to oppose SB 2 (89th). I appreciate your service to our district and to Texas. My concern is that this measure could lead to unintended harms for students, educators, and families across our community.

Personal Impact (add 2-4 sentences about how this bill affects you, your school, or your community).

Key Concerns:
• Redirects public funds away from neighborhood public schools without equivalent accountability or transparency for private recipients.
• Potentially disadvantages rural districts and small towns with limited private school options, stretching already-tight budgets.
• Unclear safeguards for students with disabilities and English learners regarding admissions, services, and due process.
• Fiscal impact could grow over time as eligibility expands, creating budget pressure on core public education programs.

What I'm Asking:
• Oppose SB 2 or support amendments that require strong fiscal caps and independent audits on ESA spending.
• Condition ESA participation on nondiscrimination, special education protections, and transparent reporting comparable to public schools.
• Prioritize investments in teacher pay, student supports, and campus resources before creating new subsidy programs.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss this further with your staff. Please let me know where you currently stand on this bill and how you plan to protect students, educators, and our community.

Respectfully,

[Your Name]
