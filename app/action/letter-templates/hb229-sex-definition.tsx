Subject: Please Oppose HB 229 (89th) — Governmental Definitions & Records of Biological Sex

HB 229 defines sex as strictly male or female and directs state records and data collection accordingly.

Dear [Rep./Sen. Last Name],

As your constituent in [Your City/County/District], I'm writing to urge you to oppose HB 229 (89th). I appreciate your service to our district and to Texas. My concern is that this measure could lead to unintended harms for students, educators, and families across our community.

Personal Impact (add 2-4 sentences about how this bill affects you, your school, or your community).

Key Concerns:
• Excludes or misclassifies intersex Texans and conflicts with current medical and administrative practices.
• Creates documentation barriers for transgender Texans, impacting IDs, school records, and access to services.
• Potential conflicts with federal regulations and civil rights guidance could expose agencies to litigation.

What I'm Asking:
• Amend to include clear accommodations for intersex people and update pathways for accurate records.
• Conduct legal and fiscal impact analyses regarding federal compliance and downstream administrative costs.
• Engage health and education experts to design evidence-based, rights-respecting data standards.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss this further with your staff. Please let me know where you currently stand on this bill and how you plan to protect students, educators, and our community.

Respectfully,

[Your Name]
