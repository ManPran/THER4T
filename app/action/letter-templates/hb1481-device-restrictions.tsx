Subject: Please Oppose HB 1481 (89th) — Student Use of Personal Communication Devices

HB 1481 requires districts to prohibit student use of phones/tablets/smartwatches during the school day (district-issued devices excluded).

Dear [Rep./Sen. Last Name],

As your constituent in [Your City/County/District], I'm writing to urge you to oppose HB 1481 (89th). I appreciate your service to our district and to Texas. My concern is that this measure could lead to unintended harms for students, educators, and families across our community.

Personal Impact (add 2-4 sentences about how this bill affects you, your school, or your community).

Key Concerns:
• One-size-fits-all prohibition can hinder CTE, dual-credit, translation, and accessibility tools some students rely on.
• Enforcement risks uneven discipline and could widen disparities if penalties are subjective or inconsistent across campuses.
• Emergency communication concerns for families; carve-outs and clear protocols are essential.
• Implementation will require staff time and training; without resources, compliance may strain classrooms.

What I'm Asking:
• Adopt amendments (or district policy guidance) for emergency/medical/IEP/504 exceptions and limited educational-use windows.
• Require transparent discipline guidelines with data reporting to monitor disparate impact.
• Fund implementation (secure lockers, staff training) rather than imposing unfunded mandates.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss this further with your staff. Please let me know where you currently stand on this bill and how you plan to protect students, educators, and our community.

Respectfully,

[Your Name]
