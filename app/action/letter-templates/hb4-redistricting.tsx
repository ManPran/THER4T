Subject: Please Oppose HB 4 (89th, 2nd Called Session) — Congressional Redistricting Plan (PlanC2333)

HB 4 establishes a new congressional map for elections beginning in 2026.

Dear [Rep./Sen. Last Name],

As your constituent in [Your City/County/District], I'm writing to urge you to oppose HB 4 (89th, 2nd Called Session). I appreciate your service to our district and to Texas. My concern is that this measure could lead to unintended harms for students, educators, and families across our community.

Personal Impact (add 2-4 sentences about how this bill affects you, your school, or your community).

Key Concerns:
• Community representation: boundaries split historic communities of interest, weakening local voices.
• Voting rights: concerns about minority vote dilution merit transparent analysis and public input.
• Process legitimacy: mid-decade redistricting without robust hearings reduces public trust.

What I'm Asking:
• Hold additional public hearings and publish district-level impact assessments before final implementation.
• Adopt neutral redistricting criteria and commit to an independent or bipartisan commission in future cycles.
• Ensure accessible challenge and correction mechanisms where communities show clear harm.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss this further with your staff. Please let me know where you currently stand on this bill and how you plan to protect students, educators, and our community.

Respectfully,

[Your Name]
